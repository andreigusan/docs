## Tips for Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Test Invoice Series">
    Create a dedicated TEST series to keep test invoices separate from production data. See our [Testing Guide](/api-reference/testing) for details.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Start with Draft Invoices">
    When testing, use `"is_draft": true` to create draft invoices that can be easily deleted.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with Romanian VAT Rates">
    Use the correct VAT rates: 19% (standard), 9% (reduced), 5% (reduced), or 0% (exempt).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Rate Limits">
    The API allows 100 requests per minute. The collection includes retry logic for rate-limited requests.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
  **401 Unauthorized**: Check that your API key is correctly set in the environment variables and includes the `Bearer` prefix in the Authorization header.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **SSL Certificate Errors**: If you encounter SSL errors during local testing, you can temporarily disable SSL verification in Postman settings (not recommended for production).
</Note>

## Updates

We regularly update our Postman collection with new endpoints and improvements. Check back periodically for the latest version.
