## Important Notes

### Permanent Deletion
<Warning>
  Product deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. The product table does not use soft deletes.
</Warning>

### Invoice Dependencies
Products that have been used in any invoice (draft or finalized) cannot be deleted. This ensures data integrity and prevents broken references in your invoices.

If you need to stop using a product, consider:
1. Updating its name to indicate it's discontinued
2. Setting a price of 0 to prevent accidental use
3. Creating a new product for replacements

### Alternative Approaches
Instead of deleting products, you might want to:
- Update the product name to include "[DISCONTINUED]"
- Set special pricing to indicate unavailability
- Use product categories to organize active vs. inactive products

## Stock Management Note
The stock management endpoint (`/api/v1/products/{id}/stock`) is not implemented as the product table does not support inventory tracking. If you need stock management, this must be handled through a separate system or custom implementation.
