## Overview

Voids an invoice by marking it as cancelled. Voided invoices remain visible in the system and API for audit and compliance purposes but cannot be edited or sent to clients.

### How Voiding Works

When you void an invoice:
1. The invoice is marked with `status: "voided"` 
2. It remains accessible via API (returns with voided status)
3. It cannot be edited or modified
4. It can optionally be deleted later if it's the last in its series

### Void vs Delete

| Action | Result | Visibility | Use Case |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Void** | Invoice marked as cancelled | Remains visible with `status: "voided"` | Fiscal compliance, audit trail |
| **Delete** | Invoice removed from database | Returns 404 error | Final cleanup of voided drafts or last voided invoice in series |

<Note>
  **Audit Trail**: Voided invoices are kept in the system for compliance and audit purposes. They appear in lists and can be retrieved individually, always showing `status: "voided"`.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Sequential Numbering**: For fiscal compliance, invoice numbers must remain sequential. A voided invoice can only be deleted if it's the last invoice in its series.
</Warning>

## Important Notes

### Void Restrictions

- Cannot void an already voided invoice
- Cannot void paid invoices (must refund first)
- Cannot void e-Factura submitted invoices without proper cancellation

### Audit Trail

All void operations are logged for audit purposes including:
- User who initiated the void
- Timestamp of operation
- Reason provided (if any)

## Common Use Cases

### Cancel Wrong Invoice

```javascript
// Void an invoice created by mistake
const response = await voidInvoice('inv_wrong123', {
  reason: 'Created with wrong client information'
});

if (response.success) {
  console.log('Invoice voided successfully');
}
```

### Void Before Deletion

```javascript
// Must void fiscal invoice before deletion
const voidResponse = await voidInvoice('inv_abc123');

if (voidResponse.success) {
  // Now can delete the voided invoice
  const deleteResponse = await deleteInvoice('inv_abc123');
}
```

### Handle Duplicate Invoices

```javascript
// Void duplicate invoice
const response = await voidInvoice('inv_duplicate', {
  reason: 'Duplicate - see invoice CTZ-2024-003'
});

// Original invoice remains valid
```

<Warning>
  Voiding a fiscal invoice is a permanent action that creates accounting records. Ensure you really want to void the invoice before calling this endpoint.
