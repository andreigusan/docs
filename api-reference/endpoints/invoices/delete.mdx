title: 'Delete Invoice'
api: 'DELETE /invoices/{id}'
description: 'Permanently delete a voided or draft invoice'
---

## Overview

Permanently removes an invoice from the database. This is an irreversible action - deleted invoices cannot be recovered and will return 404 errors on all API calls.

### Understanding Invoice States

| State | Database Status | API Visibility | Can Delete? |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Active** | Record exists | Fully visible | No - must void first |
| **Voided** | Record exists with cancelled flag | Visible with `status: "voided"` | Yes - if last in series |
| **Deleted** | Record removed | Returns 404 | N/A - already gone |

### Deletion Rules

Invoices can only be deleted if they are:

1. **Draft invoices** - Can always be deleted
2. **Voided invoices** - Can be deleted only if:
   - They are the last invoice in their series (for sequential numbering)
   - No newer invoices exist with the same series

### Workflow for Deleting Fiscal Invoices

```
Active Invoice → Void → Delete (if last in series)
```

<Note>
  **Sequential Numbering Requirement**: Romanian fiscal regulations require invoice numbers to be sequential with no gaps. A voided invoice can only be deleted if it's the last in the series to prevent numbering gaps.
</Note>

<Warning>
  **Permanent Action**: Deletion completely removes the invoice from the database. This action cannot be undone. For audit trail purposes, consider keeping invoices as voided instead of deleting them.

## Important Notes

### Deletion Process

- Invoices are marked with `is_deleted = 1` in the database
- Deleted invoices return "404 Not Found" when accessed via API
- Deleted invoices are excluded from list endpoints
- Deletion cannot be reversed
- The invoice data is retained in the database for audit and compliance purposes but is inaccessible via API

### Compliance Requirements

Romanian fiscal regulations require:
- Numbered invoices must be voided before deletion
- **Invoice numbers must remain sequential** - you can only delete the last invoice in a series
- Audit trail must be maintained for all fiscal documents
- Deleted invoices are kept for the legally required retention period

### Sequential Numbering Rule

To maintain fiscal compliance with sequential invoice numbering:
- When deleting a voided invoice with a number, the system checks if it's the last in its series
- If newer invoices exist in the same series, deletion is blocked
- This prevents gaps in the middle of the invoice number sequence
- Draft invoices (without numbers) can be deleted at any time

### What Gets Deleted

When an invoice is deleted:
- The invoice record is marked as deleted
- Associated invoice lines are marked as deleted
- Payment records remain for accounting integrity
- E-Factura submissions (if any) are retained for compliance

## Common Use Cases

### Delete a Draft Invoice

```javascript
// Delete draft invoice that was never finalized
const response = await fetch('https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices/inv_draft123', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
});

if (response.ok) {
  console.log('Draft invoice deleted');
}
```

### Delete After Voiding (Last in Series)

```javascript
// Step 1: Void the fiscal invoice
const voidResponse = await fetch('https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices/inv_abc123/void', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    reason: 'Duplicate invoice'
  })
});

// Step 2: Delete the voided invoice (only works if it's the last in series)
if (voidResponse.ok) {
  const deleteResponse = await fetch('https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices/inv_abc123', {
    method: 'DELETE',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  
  if (deleteResponse.ok) {
    console.log('Voided invoice deleted successfully');
  } else {
    const error = await deleteResponse.json();
    if (error.error.code === 'invoice_not_last_in_series') {
      console.log('Cannot delete - newer invoices exist in this series');
    }
  }
}
```

### Check Series Before Deletion

```javascript
// Example: Delete the last voided invoice in a series
async function deleteLastVoidedInvoice(seriesId) {
  // Get all invoices in the series
  const invoices = await fetch(`https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices?series_id=${seriesId}&sort=number&order=desc`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY' }
  });
  
  const data = await invoices.json();
  
  // Check if the last invoice is voided
  const lastInvoice = data.data[0];
  if (lastInvoice && lastInvoice.status === 'voided') {
    // Safe to delete - it's the last in the series
    const deleteResponse = await fetch(`https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices/${lastInvoice.id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY' }
    });
    
    if (deleteResponse.ok) {
      console.log(`Deleted last voided invoice: ${lastInvoice.invoice_number}`);
      return true;
    }
  }
  
  console.log('Cannot delete - invoice is not voided or not last in series');
  return false;
}
```


## Error Handling

```javascript
async function deleteInvoice(invoiceId) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.contazen.ro/v1/invoices/${invoiceId}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_live_YOUR_API_KEY'
      }
    });
    
    const result = await response.json();
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      if (result.error.code === 'invoice_not_deletable') {
        // Invoice needs to be voided first
        console.log('Invoice must be voided first');
        // Optionally trigger void process
      } else if (response.status === 404) {
        console.log('Invoice not found or already deleted');
      } else {
        console.error('Delete failed:', result.error.message);
      }
      return false;
    }
    
    console.log('Invoice deleted:', result.data.id);
    return true;
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Request failed:', error);
    return false;
  }
}
```

<Note>
  Deletion is permanent. Consider using the void endpoint if you need to cancel an invoice while maintaining a complete audit trail.
