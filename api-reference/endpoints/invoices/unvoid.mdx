## Description

Unvoids (reactivates) a previously voided invoice, making it active again. This operation restores the invoice to its pre-void state and, if applicable, restores e-Factura availability if the invoice hasn't been sent to ANAF.

<Note>
  **Important**: Only voided invoices can be unvoided. Deleted invoices cannot be recovered as they are permanently removed from the system.
</Note>

## Request

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The invoice ID to unvoid
</ParamField>

## Invoice State Transitions

| Current State | Can Unvoid? | Result State | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Voided | ✅ Yes | Active (Issued/Paid) | Restores to pre-void state |
| Active | ❌ No | - | Invoice is already active |
| Draft | ❌ No | - | Drafts cannot be voided/unvoided |
| Deleted | ❌ No | - | Deleted invoices are permanently removed |

## E-Factura Behavior

When unvoiding a fiscal invoice:
- If the invoice was **not yet sent** to ANAF: `efactura_available` is restored to `true`
- If the invoice was **already sent** to ANAF: `efactura_available` remains `false` (cannot resend)
- Non-fiscal invoices are not affected

## Use Cases

### Accidental Void Recovery
If an invoice was voided by mistake, you can quickly restore it to active status:
```javascript
// Accidentally voided the wrong invoice
await api.invoices.void('inv_wrong_one');

// Restore it immediately
await api.invoices.unvoid('inv_wrong_one');
```

### Reprocessing Workflow
When you need to temporarily void and then restore invoices for batch processing:
```javascript
// Void for processing
await api.invoices.void(invoiceId);

// Do some processing...

// Restore if conditions are met
if (shouldRestore) {
  await api.invoices.unvoid(invoiceId);
}
```
