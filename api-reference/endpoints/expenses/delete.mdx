title: 'Delete Expense'
openapi: 'DELETE /expenses/{id}'
description: 'Delete an expense record with proper validation and soft delete functionality'
---

## Overview

The Delete Expense endpoint allows you to remove an expense from your records. The system performs a soft delete, which means the expense is marked as deleted but preserved in the database for audit and compliance purposes.

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent from the user perspective and cannot be undone through the API. Ensure you really want to delete the expense before calling this endpoint.
</Warning>

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="id" type="string" required>
  The CzUid of the expense to delete
</ParamField>

## Business Rules

The system will validate that the expense can be safely deleted:

- **Accounting periods**: Expenses in closed accounting periods may not be deletable
- **Integration locks**: Expenses that have been synchronized with external systems may be protected
- **Audit requirements**: Some expenses may be required to be kept for compliance reasons

If an expense cannot be deleted due to business rules, the API will return an appropriate error message.

## Response

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  Confirmation message that the expense has been deleted
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  The CzUid of the deleted expense for reference
</ResponseField>

## Soft Delete Behavior

When an expense is deleted:

1. **Status Update**: The expense is marked as deleted in the database
2. **Timestamp**: A deletion timestamp is recorded
3. **List Exclusion**: The expense will no longer appear in standard list endpoints
4. **Audit Trail**: The deletion is logged for audit purposes
5. **Data Preservation**: All expense data is preserved for compliance and reporting

## Impact on Related Data

Deleting an expense affects related data:

- **Statistics**: The expense is excluded from future statistics calculations
- **Totals**: List totals will be recalculated without this expense
- **Reports**: The expense will not appear in standard reports
- **Attachments**: Any attached files remain in the system but are marked as orphaned

<RequestExample>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.contazen.ro/v1/expenses/exp_abc123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const expenseId = 'exp_abc123';

const response = await fetch(`https://api.contazen.ro/v1/expenses/${expenseId}`, {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
if (data.success) {
  console.log('Expense deleted successfully:', data.id);
} else {
  console.error('Failed to delete expense:', data.error.message);
}
```

```php PHP
$expenseId = 'exp_abc123';

$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt_array($curl, [
    CURLOPT_URL => "https://api.contazen.ro/v1/expenses/{$expenseId}",
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST => 'DELETE',
    CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
        'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type: application/json'
    ]
]);

$response = curl_exec($curl);
$data = json_decode($response, true);
curl_close($curl);

if ($data['success']) {
    echo 'Expense deleted successfully: ' . $data['id'];
} else {
    echo 'Error: ' . $data['error']['message'];
}

## Best Practices

### Before Deleting
1. **Verify the expense**: Use the [Retrieve Expense](/api-reference/endpoints/expenses/retrieve) endpoint to confirm you have the correct expense
2. **Check dependencies**: Ensure the expense is not referenced by other records
3. **Consider alternatives**: Sometimes updating an expense to mark it as cancelled is preferable to deletion

### After Deletion
1. **Update local records**: Remove the expense from any local caches or displays
2. **Refresh totals**: Update any calculated totals in your application
3. **Notify users**: Inform relevant users that the expense has been removed

### Error Handling
Always handle potential errors gracefully:
- **404 errors**: The expense may have already been deleted or the ID is incorrect
- **403 errors**: Business rules prevent deletion - inform the user why
- **500 errors**: Technical issues - retry or contact support

### Alternative Actions
Consider these alternatives to deletion:
- **Void the expense**: Mark it as cancelled while preserving the record
- **Reduce amount to zero**: Keep the expense but remove its financial impact
- **Archive**: Move to an archived status instead of deleting
