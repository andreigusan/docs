## Current Version

The Contazen API is currently at version **v1**, which is included in all API URLs:

```
https://app.contazen.ro/api/v1/...
```

## Version Header

Every API response includes the version in the metadata:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "version": "v1",
    "response_time": "12.45ms"
  }
}
```

## Stability

The v1 API is stable and production-ready. We are committed to maintaining backward compatibility for all v1 endpoints.

## Backward Compatible Changes

We may add the following without changing the API version:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Additions" icon="plus">
    - New endpoints
    - New optional parameters
    - New response fields
    - Additional functionality
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensions" icon="expand">
    - Additional error codes
    - Extended enum values
    - New status types
    - Enhanced features
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Breaking Changes

If we need to make breaking changes in the future, we will:

1. Release a new API version (v2)
2. Maintain v1 alongside the new version
3. Provide clear migration documentation
4. Give advance notice to all API users

Examples of breaking changes include:
- Removing endpoints or required parameters
- Changing response structure
- Modifying authentication methods
- Altering core business logic

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Handle Unknown Fields" icon="code">
    Your integration should gracefully handle new fields in API responses. Don't use strict parsing that fails when encountering unknown fields.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check Response Status" icon="shield-check">
    Always check the HTTP status code and the `success` field in responses. Don't assume requests succeeded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stay Informed" icon="bell">
    Monitor your registered email for any API updates or announcements.
