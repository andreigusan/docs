## Overview

API requests are rate limited to ensure stability and fair usage for all users.

## Rate Limit

<Card title="API Rate Limit" icon="gauge">
  **100 requests per minute**
  
  All API keys are subject to this rate limit to ensure fair usage and stability.
</Card>

## Rate Limit Headers

Every API response includes headers with rate limit information:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests allowed |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time when the rate limit resets (Unix timestamp) |

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "type": "rate_limit_error",
    "code": "rate_limit_exceeded",
    "retry_after": 45,
    "status": 429
  }
}
```

The `retry_after` field indicates how many seconds to wait before retrying.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Exponential Backoff" icon="clock">
    When rate limited, implement exponential backoff:
    
    ```javascript
    async function makeRequestWithBackoff(url, options, maxRetries = 3) {
      for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        const response = await fetch(url, options);
        
        if (response.status !== 429) {
          return response;
        }
        
        const retryAfter = response.headers.get('Retry-After') || Math.pow(2, i);
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
      }
      
      throw new Error('Max retries exceeded');
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cache Responses" icon="database">
    Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls:
    - Client lists that don't change often
    - Product catalogs
    - Static configuration data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Batch Operations" icon="layer-group">
    Where possible, use batch operations:
    - Create multiple invoices in a single request
    - Fetch data with appropriate pagination limits
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor Usage" icon="chart-line">
    Track your API usage:
    - Log rate limit headers
    - Set up alerts for high usage
    - Plan for traffic spikes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Increasing Rate Limits

If you need higher rate limits for your application:

1. Contact support at contact@contazen.ro
2. Provide details about your use case
3. Include your current usage patterns
4. Explain expected growth

We'll work with you to ensure your application has the resources it needs.
