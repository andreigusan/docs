## Overview

The Contazen API implements multiple layers of security to protect your data and ensure safe integrations. This page outlines our security measures and best practices for using the API securely.

## Authentication

### API Keys
- All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens
- API keys start with `sk_live_` for production and `sk_test_` for testing
- Keys are tied to specific firms and have granular permissions
- Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories

### Best Practices
- Rotate your API keys regularly
- Use environment variables to store keys
- Implement IP whitelisting when possible
- Monitor API usage for unusual patterns

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- All API traffic must use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher)
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Database connections use SSL certificates

## Audit Logging

We maintain comprehensive audit logs for security and compliance:

- All API requests are logged with timestamps
- Authentication attempts tracked
- File uploads and modifications recorded
- Logs retained for compliance periods

## Compliance

The Contazen API complies with:

- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **Romanian e-Factura** requirements
- **PCI DSS** for payment processing (where applicable)

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** disclose it publicly
2. Email contact@contazen.ro with details
3. Include steps to reproduce if possible
4. We aim to respond ASAP

## Security Checklist for Integrations

When building integrations with our API:

- [ ] Store API keys securely (environment variables, secrets management)
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all requests
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive details
- [ ] Validate all inputs before sending to API
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor for unusual activity patterns
- [ ] Keep dependencies and libraries up to date
- [ ] Use the principle of least privilege for API key permissions
- [ ] Implement proper logging without storing sensitive data
- [ ] Regular security audits of your integration
